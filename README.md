# About Me

Iâ€™ve been working as a **care worker in the elder care field for over 15 years**,  
supporting residents in special nursing homes with daily living assistance and compassion.  
Alongside my caregiving work, Iâ€™m also an **independent app developer**,  
creating tools that make caregiving tasks smoother and more efficient for staff and families alike.

To bridge **elder care and technology**,  
and bring practical, human-centered apps to the caregiving field.
